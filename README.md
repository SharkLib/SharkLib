I want share my experience to every one who want to learn
 - Qt
 - VTK
 - Python
 
It includes 4 parts, one is the basic knowledge of Qt, and another is how to use VTK in Qt.

[Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) is a great liabrary to implement C++ software cross platform, once you finished your implement, you are ability to compile application for Windows, Mac, Linux, even Android and iOS.

[VTK](https://vtk.org/Wiki/VTK)  is an open source, freely available software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization used by thousands of researchers and developers around the world. VTK consists of a C++ class library, and several interpreted interface layers including Python, Tcl/Tk and Java. Professional support and products for VTK are provided by Kitware, Inc. VTK supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric methods; and advanced modeling techniques such as implicit modelling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. In addition, dozens of imaging algorithms have been directly integrated to allow the user to mix 2D imaging / 3D graphics algorithms and data.
